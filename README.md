Capstone Project for IBM Coursera Data Science Course

The aim of this project is to help a travel agency recommend one out of 3 cities, Lagos, Abuja and Ghana all located in West Africa to one of their clients. The client is an American family based in South Africa. The family being a coffeee loving family is planning on a brief 2 day stopover in West Africa on their way back to South Africa to savor the local coffee scene.

The travel agancy LeisureWay Travels have approached me to help use my data science skills to help make the selection.
